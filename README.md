# Website theme selector

My own small project where the idea was to practice making a chrome extension and test it by enabling the developer mode in the extensions view. In this project, I thought that some kind of theme changer would be great especially in those websites, where is a lot of text and blank white background. Good examples of this kind of sites are news sites (e.g. Ilta-Sanomat, Iltalehti, yle...). By making this very simple extension, a user can select a theme color that suits his/her preferences the best. The second idea was that the the color of text elements could be also modified to match the most suitable option for the chosen theme. 

This project is still at the very beginning and the most important thing is to make the theme/font selections work as well as posible in different sites, and the "UI" will be upgraded throughout the development of the project. For example, you cannot change Google Chrome's starting page with this extension (I think they prevent doing this) but one idea was a quick button and pressing that takes user to settings page where user can change the Chrome's theme easily to dark one. This could help some of the users to change the theme. 

Here is example of Yle.fi news site with original theme:

And here we have example of scenario, where user have selected "blue" theme and "black" font:
